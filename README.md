# alarm-clock

In this project I will create a full-stack alarm clock. This clock will display in a digital time format, you will be able to change between 12-hour and 24-hour formats, set a time for the clock to go off, it will update every second without refreshing the page, and display an alert for when the alarm is supposed to go off.
